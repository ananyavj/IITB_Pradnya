## REAL  NUMBERS

(A) Main Concepts and Results

• Euclid’s Division Lemma : Given two positive integers a and b , there exist unique integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r , 0 ≤ r < b .

• Euclid’s Division Algorithm to obtain the HCF of two positive integers, say c and d , c > d .

Step 1 : Apply Euclid’s division lemma to c and d , to find whole numbers q and r , such that c = dq + r , 0 ≤ r < d .

Step 2 : If r = 0, d is the HCF of c and d . If r ≠ 0, apply the division lemma to d and r .

Step 3 : Continue the process till the remainder is zero. The divisor at this stage will be the required HCF.

• Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic : Every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes, and this expression (factorisation) is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.

• Let p be a prime number. If p divides a 2 , then p divides a , where a is a positive integer.

• 2 , 3 , 5 are irrational numbers.

• The sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational.

• The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

• For any two positive integers a and b , HCF ( a, b ) × LCM ( a, b ) = a × b.

2 EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS

• Let x = p q , p and q are co-prime, be a rational number whose decimal expansion terminates. Then, the prime factorisation of q is of the form 2 m .5 n ; m , n are non-negative integers.

• Let x = p q be a rational number such that the prime factorisation of q is not of the form 2 m .5 n ; m , n being non-negative integers. Then, x has a non-terminating repeating decimal expansion.

(C) Short Answer Questions with Reasoning

Sample Question 1: The values of the remainder r , when a positive integer a is divided by 3 are 0 and 1 only. Justify your answer.

Solution : No.

4 EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS According to Euclid’s division lemma, a = 3 q + r , where 0 ≤ r < 3 and r is an integer. Therefore, the values of r can be 0, 1 or 2.

Sample Question 2: Can the number 6 n , n being a natural number, end with the digit 5? Give reasons.

Solution : No, because 6 n = (2 × 3) n = 2 n × 3 n , so the only primes in the factorisation of 6 n are 2 and 3, and not 5.

Hence, it cannot end with the digit 5.

(D) Short Answer  Questions

Sample Question 1: Using Euclid’s division algorithm, find which of the following pairs of numbers are co-prime:

(i) 231, 396         (ii) 847, 2160

Solution : Let us find the HCF of each pair of numbers.

(i) 396 = 231 × 1 + 165 231 = 165 × 1 + 66 165 = 66 × 2 + 33 66 = 33 × 2 + 0 Therefore, HCF = 33. Hence, numbers are not co-prime.

(ii) 2160 = 847 × 2 + 466 847 = 466 × 1 + 381 466 = 381 × 1 + 85 381 = 85 × 4   + 41 85   = 41 × 2   +  3 41   =   3 × 13 +  2 3     =   2 × 1  +  1 2     =   1 × 2  +  0 Therefore, the HCF = 1. Hence, the numbers are co-prime.

Sample Question 2: Show that the square of an odd positive integer is of the form 8 m + 1, for some whole number m .

Solution: Any positive odd integer is of the form 2 q + 1, where q is a whole number.

Therefore,   (2 q + 1) 2 = 4 q 2 + 4 q + 1 = 4 q ( q + 1) + 1, (1) q ( q + 1) is either 0 or even. So, it is 2 m , where m is a whole number.

Therefore,   (2 q + 1) 2 = 4.2 m + 1 = 8 m + 1.

[From (1)]

Sample Question 3: Prove that 2 3 + is irrational.

Solution : Let us suppose that 2 3 + is rational. Let 2 3 + = a , where a is rational.

6 EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS Therefore, 2 = 3 a − Squaring on both sides, we get 2 = a 2 + 3 – 2 3 a Therefore, + = , which is a contradiction as the right hand side is a rational a 2 1 3 2 a number while 3 is irrational. Hence, 2 3 + is irrational.

(E) Long Answer Questions

Sample Question 1 : Show that the square of an odd positive integer can be of the form 6 q + 1 or 6 q + 3 for some integer q .

Solution : We know that any positive integer can be of the form 6 m , 6 m + 1, 6 m + 2, 6 m + 3, 6 m + 4 or 6 m + 5, for some integer m .

Thus, an odd positive integer can be of the form 6m + 1, 6m + 3, or 6m + 5 Thus we have:

(6 m +1) 2 = 36 m 2 + 12 m + 1 = 6 (6 m 2 + 2 m ) + 1 = 6 q + 1, q is an integer (6 m + 3) 2 = 36 m 2 + 36 m + 9 = 6 (6 m 2 + 6 m + 1) + 3 = 6 q + 3, q is an integer (6 m + 5) 2 = 36 m 2 + 60 m + 25 = 6 (6 m 2 + 10 m + 4) + 1 = 6 q + 1, q is an integer.

Thus, the square of an odd positive integer can be of the form 6 q + 1 or 6 q + 3 .
